This is my first project in C programming.
This file contains a description of the different shell scripts in this project
- **0-preprocessor** - runs a C file named 'main.c' saved in the variable '$CFILE' through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file named 'c'.

- **1-compiler** - compiles a C file but does not link.
- **2-assembler** - generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
